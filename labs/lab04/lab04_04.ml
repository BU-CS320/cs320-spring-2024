(* Sorting Tuples 

   Given a tuple of integers of size 5, sort all of its elements
   WITHOUT first converting it into a list or array. *)

type tup2 = int * int
type tup3 = int * int * int
type tup4 = int * int * int * int
type tup5 = int * int * int * int * int

let sort (xs : tup5): tup5 = 
  assert false
